ðŸ‘‹ Hello There, I'm Saif!
======
I am a fourth-year Ph.D Candidate in Computer Science at [Bellini College of AI, Cybersecurity and Computing](https://www.usf.edu/ai-cybersecurity-computing/), at [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/). My research interests broadly lie in the area of applied cryptography, network security, and machine learning. My research seeks to improve the security of resource-constrained IoT devices through novel designs, formal security proofs, and full-fledged implementations.
